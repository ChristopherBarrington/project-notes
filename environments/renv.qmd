## Reproducible R environment

{{< fa paperclip >}} [`r lockfile`](`r lockfile`)

R packages were managed in this project using [`renv`][renv home]. A `lockfile` can be used by `renv` to install the version-matched R packages used in the project.

[Download](`r lockfile`) the lockfile for the project to an empty directory. Start R version `r jsonlite::read_json(lockfile)$R$Version` and use `renv::init()` to initialise a new renv-managed project. [The major/minor version is important but a different patch version _should_ still work.]{.aside}
